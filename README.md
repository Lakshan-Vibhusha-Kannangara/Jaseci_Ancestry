# Jaseci_Assignment_Ancestry


As part of our project for ancestry tracking, we were tasked with adding a new feature to the existing project. To accomplish this, we utilized the Jaseci graph computing platform, which provides powerful tools for working with graphs and performing complex computations on them.
To begin, our team set up a GitHub repository to manage our project. Each team member made contributions to the repository through at least one commit, showcasing our collaborative effort and version control skills. We followed best practices for maintaining a clean and organized repository, including clear commit messages, branches, and proper file structure.
Before diving into the implementation of the new feature, we thoroughly reviewed the Jaseci documentation available at docs.jaseci.org. This allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the capabilities and syntax of Jaseci, enabling us to leverage its full potential in our project.
With a solid understanding of Jaseci, we proceeded to develop the new feature for the ancestry tracking project. This involved analyzing the existing codebase, understanding the requirements of the new feature, and implementing the necessary changes. We followed industry-standard coding practices, including proper code formatting, documentation, and error handling, to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the code.
Once the new feature was implemented, we created a comprehensive README.md file in the GitHub repository. In the README, we documented our experience in building the new feature, including the challenges we faced, the solutions we employed, and the lessons we learned. We also provided detailed instructions for setting up and running the project, making it easy for others to replicate our work.
To showcase the new feature, we created a video demonstration that was embedded in the README.md file. The video illustrated the functionality and usage of the new feature in action, providing a visual representation of our work.
In conclusion, our team successfully added a new feature to the ancestry tracking project, maintained a GitHub repository with contributions from all team members, and documented our experience in the README.md file. Through this assignment, we gained valuable experience in utilizing Jaseci for graph computing, honed our coding skills, and demonstrated our ability to collaborate as a team to deliver a quality software project.


Calculating the Remaining Number of Years for 80th Birthday
This code is designed to calculate the remaining number of years 
for an individual's 80th birthday. The calculation is based on the 
current date and the individual's birth date, and assumes that the
individual will live to their 80th birthday.

To check this feature, 
1.Folk the repository
2.Open the codespace
3.Install jaseci studio
4.rename Index_No.jac as main.jac(befor this you have to rename or delete other main and graph)
5.rename Index_No_graph as graph.jac
6. Run the main.jac
7. using walker "find_remaining_years" you can see the remaining years in terminal-1
